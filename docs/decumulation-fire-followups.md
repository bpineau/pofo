# Decumulation / FIRE — follow-ups backlog

Running list of oddities to fix and enhancements to evaluate, from the fresh
`pkg/scenario` + `pkg/decumul` + `pkg/decumul/web` implementation (designs:
`decumulation-fire-design.md`, `decumulation-monthly-sampling-design.md`).
Not yet scheduled; each item should get its own brainstorm → spec → plan when
picked up. Priority: **P1** correctness, **P2** clarity/API, **P3** features.

> **Realism / conservatism** of the ruin figures (the model is optimistic vs the
> broad-sample SWR evidence) has its own spec:
> [`decumulation-fire-realism-spec.md`](decumulation-fire-realism-spec.md)
> (default flex off, honest return defaults + conservative prior, sequence-risk
> capture, longevity horizon).
>
> **Usability rewrite (2026-06-30):** the explorer is being rebuilt around a
> multi-model comparison, visible simulated markets, and an actionable safe-WR
> headline. Spec: [`decumulation-fire-rewrite-spec.md`](decumulation-fire-rewrite-spec.md)
> (synthesis of Ben's brief, a ChatGPT thread, and Claude's analysis in
> [`decumulation-fire-usability-proposals.md`](decumulation-fire-usability-proposals.md)).
> The regime mean-tanking bug it identified is already fixed (commit d96e4a1).
> Deferred to phase 2: bundle a broad-sample century-long real-return panel
> under `pkg/datasets/` so the historical models see 1900s-2020s regimes.

## Correctness oddities (P1)

1. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Ruin is tested on net need, not the grossed-up
   withdrawal.**
   `Plan.RunPath` flags ruin with `if need > total` (net), but the money that
   must actually be liquidated is the *gross* (need + tax, and buffer refills).
   With the cost-basis `CTOFlatTax`, gross can substantially exceed net at high
   embedded gains, so ruin can be under-flagged. The golden tests pass because
   they use a flat-12% stub and a no-buffer plan, which masks it. Fix: define
   ruin as "the gross required to deliver `need` exceeds available liquidity",
   computed consistently across the buffer-first and growth-first branches.

2. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29, with item 1).** **Partial-funding is silent.** `Tax.GrossUp` caps `gross` at `growth`, so a
   year that cannot fully fund `need` sells everything and delivers *less* net
   than needed, yet `RunPath` still does `Withdrawn += need` and may not latch
   ruin. The household "didn't get its money" without the path being marked.
   Fix together with (1): detect under-delivery (buffer drain + net deliverable
   from growth < need) and latch ruin; account the real net withdrawn.

3. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **`0` is overloaded as "unset" in `BufferSleeve`.** `DrawThreshold == 0`
   and `RefillCap == 0` are treated as "use the default" (0.10 / 0.50), so a
   user cannot intentionally set a 0 threshold or a no-refill policy. Use
   explicit defaults at construction, sentinel `-1`, or pointer fields.

4. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **`Sweep2D(_, Mu, …)` on a non-parametric plan is a silent no-op.**
   `Plan.set(Mu, …)` only mutates a `ParametricSource`; for bootstrap/cohort
   sources it does nothing, so the surface comes out flat with no error. The
   web layer dodges this by switching the y-axis, but the library API should
   either return an error or document the constraint loudly.

5. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **`worst10y` uses a `-1` sentinel** to mean "hit
   zero within the window", then aggregates by `min`, so a single ruined path
   drives `Worst10yCAGR` to −100%. Arguably correct but the sentinel conflates
   "−100% realised" with "undefined"; revisit the representation (e.g. report
   separately the share of paths with a sub-`-x%` decade).
   Fixed: `worst10y` now returns `(cagr, ok)`, treating a decade that *ends* at
   zero as its realised −100% and *skipping* windows that *start* after ruin
   (the conflated case); `Outcome` keeps the honest min `Worst10yCAGR` and adds
   a robust `Worst10yP5` (5th-percentile of paths' worst decade) so one ruined
   path no longer defines the headline.

## Clarity / API (P2)

6. ✅ **Obsolete (2026-06-29).** **2D surface y-axis silently changes meaning**
   (real CAGR for parametric, spending floor for the historical models). The
   heatmap title says "scenario axis (y)" generically; label the axis
   dynamically and state the unit. The web heatmap was dropped in commit
   `fd5a75b`; `chart.Heatmap`/`Sweep2D` are no longer rendered anywhere, and the
   Mu-on-non-parametric ambiguity is now a loud library error (item 4). No
   surface axis remains to label.

7. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Monthly→annual compounding is
   rolling-from-window-start, not calendar years.** For cohorts a 15y window
   compounds months `[0..11], [12..23], …` from the cohort start, so the
   "annual" returns are not Jan–Dec. Statistically fine; document it so it is
   not mistaken for a bug. Documented on `scenario.Annualize`.

8. **Common-window alignment truncates to the last N months/returns** assuming
   the month grids line up across holdings. Dense simdata-extended series make
   this safe in practice, but a holding with internal gaps could misalign. A
   date-keyed alignment (intersect on month keys) would be robust.

9. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **`FitParametric` does not fit `df`** and estimates
   annual sigma from ~20 annualised points (noisy). Consider deriving annual vol
   from monthly returns (`σ_m·√12`) for stability, and optionally fitting `df`
   from the sample kurtosis to seed the fat-tail slider from history.
   Done: `FitParametric` now returns a `Fit{Mu, Sigma, Df}`; sigma is the
   monthly std × √12, and df is seeded from the monthly excess kurtosis
   (inverting the Student-t 6/(df−4)), clamped to the slider range and exposed
   via `/api/meta` + `/api/fit` so the df slider is seeded from history too.

## Features / "most useful FIRE info" (P3)

10. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Surface the computed-but-hidden metrics.**
    `Outcome` already produces median years underwater, worst-10y real CAGR and
    CDaR (and the recovery histogram is shown); add cards/panels for the rest,
    plus median cumulative tax and effective tax rate. Done: `Outcome` gained
    `MedianCumTax` and `EffectiveTaxRate`, and the web UI now shows cards for
    median years underwater, worst-10y real CAGR (both the robust p5 and the
    min), CDaR, median cumulative tax and the effective tax rate.

11. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Allocation A/B comparison.** Pin a baseline
    allocation and show a variant side by side (the original motivating
    question: "60/25/15 vs 20/20/…"), rather than only re-dragging one set of
    weights. Done: added `Compare` + `/api/compare`, each allocation re-fitted
    from the panel for a fair test; a "Pin allocation as baseline" button toggles
    A/B mode, rendering baseline vs variant cards side by side.

12. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Solve in the UI.** Expose `CapitalForRuin` and a
    buffer optimiser: given a target ruin %, show the required capital and the
    ruin-minimising buffer. Done: added `Plan.BestBuffer` (argmin ruin over
    candidate buffer years), a `/api/solve` endpoint returning the required
    capital (`CapitalForRuin`) and the ruin-minimising buffer, and a Solve panel
    in the UI (target-ruin input + button + result line).

13. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** Implemented `RunPathMonthly` (steps monthly,
    withdraws NeedAnnual/12, evaluates drawdown/flex/bucket monthly, applies one
    monthly real return; buffer years / horizon / cashflow years stay
    year-valued; buffer return applied as its 12th root; Wealth reported at
    annual granularity). A `Plan.Monthly` flag + `runPath` dispatcher route
    `Simulate`/sweeps through it while the annual `RunPath` stays the validated
    golden reference. The web exposes a "Monthly withdrawals" toggle: historical
    models feed the monthly source directly (no Compounded wrapper), parametric
    draws monthly i.i.d. shocks that compound to the annual mu/sigma. Below is
    the original note.

    **Monthly withdrawal kernel (stated requirement, P2-ish).** Ben's real
    use case is a **monthly** withdrawal, like a salary, and the buffer-vs-cut
    re-evaluation ("tap the buffer or cut this month's spend 25%?") is also a
    **monthly** decision. So the kernel should step monthly: withdraw
    NeedAnnual/12 each month, evaluate drawdown/flex/bucket monthly, apply one
    monthly real return per step. Crucially, **the durations that are naturally
    in years stay in years**: buffer size (years × annual spend), life horizon,
    and years-before-retirement are still year-valued inputs. This pairs
    naturally with the monthly return panel already built (a monthly Source
    feeds the kernel directly, no Compounded wrapper for this path). Keep the
    annual kernel + its golden tests as the validated reference; the monthly
    kernel needs its own validation targets. Bigger change, but it is what the
    real plan needs, so prioritise above the other P3 items.

14. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Richer policies.** Melting/glidepath buffer (stop
    refilling after the sequence-risk window), a distinct inflation-linked sleeve
    vs pure cash, side income (rental/activity) as another `Cashflow`, and a
    guardrails withdrawal rule (Guyton-Klinger style) beyond the single flex cut.
    Done: `BufferSleeve.RefillStopYear` (glidepath), `Cashflow.ToYear` (bounded
    side income), `Plan.Guard` Guyton-Klinger guardrails (yearly spending band on
    the withdrawal rate, replacing flex when set) — all in both kernels and
    exposed in the web (side-income + glidepath sliders, a guardrails toggle).
    The inflation-linked-vs-cash distinction is the existing `RealReturn` /
    "buffer real return" knob (≈0 for a linker, negative for cash), so no
    separate sleeve was needed.

15. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Shareable scenarios.** URL-encode the
    slider/allocation state so a configuration can be bookmarked or shared (the
    server is local, so this is cheap). Done: the slider values, return model and
    allocation weights round-trip through the URL hash; `run()` writes the hash
    after each compute and the page applies a shared hash on load (shared
    mu/sigma/df override the historical seed).

16. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Performance.** Each `/api/sim` runs Sweep1D + a
    full Simulate + Sweep2D, i.e. many independent Monte-Carlo passes per slider
    drag. Share pre-drawn paths across the sweep evaluations (as
    `CapitalForRuin` already does) to cut the per-request cost, especially at
    higher path counts. Done: split `Simulate` into `drawPaths` + `simulateOn`;
    `Sweep1D` (for every parameter but Mu, which rebuilds the Source) and
    `CapitalForRuin` now draw the paths once and reuse them. Behaviour is
    byte-identical, locked by a regression test comparing the shared-path sweep
    to a per-value `Simulate`. (Sweep2D is no longer run; the heatmap was
    dropped, see item 6.)

17. **STILL OPEN — Design pass on the `-fire` UI with the frontend-design skill.**
    Note (2026-07-01): the usability rewrite rebuilt the explorer
    (`pkg/decumul/web/assets/`) with a live hero strip, the multi-model table,
    the fan / frontier / sensitivity charts and instant tooltips, but again
    **functionally, not designed** — layout, typography, colour, chart styling,
    visual hierarchy and mobile were not given a deliberate pass. Do it with the
    `frontend-design` skill on the NEW UI (colour system across the model strip
    cells and the per-model chart series, the allocation-bar styling, the dense
    hero + tabs layout, and mobile). Highest-value cosmetic follow-up.

18. ✅ **Done (2026-06-29).** **Better charts for the buffer arbitrage and the
    recovery distribution.** Specific chart requirements (part of, or before,
    item 17):
    - Replace the two separate bar charts with a SINGLE dual-axis line chart:
      buffer years on x, ruin % on the LEFT y-axis, median terminal wealth on
      the RIGHT y-axis. Done via a new `chart.LineDual` primitive; the web shows
      one "Buffer arbitrage" chart instead of two bar charts.
    - The recovery-time distribution bars need readable numbers: add y-axis
      gridlines/ticks with labels and value labels on the bars. Done: `chart.Bars`
      now draws y-axis gridlines + tick labels and an optional per-bar value
      label (`Bar.Text`); the recovery chart passes shares as % with "NN%"
      labels.

## Portfolio analysis / report (not FIRE-specific)

17. **Volatility term structure in the comparison table (approved direction).**
    ✅ **Done (2026-06-29):** added `metrics.VarianceRatio` (Lo-MacKinlay) returning
    a `VolTermStructure` (daily vol, monthly-annualised vol, the ratio, sample
    size), and surfaced two new rows in the comparison table ("Volatility
    (monthly, annualised)" and "Variance ratio (monthly/daily)") with an
    explanatory footnote covering the interpretation and the small-sample caveat.
    The FIRE-seeding / monthly-Sharpe reuse (the last sub-bullet) is still open.
    The report currently ranks portfolios by **daily-annualised** volatility
    (and Sharpe/Sortino built on it), which over/understates the dispersion an
    investor actually realises at a multi-year horizon: it overstates when
    returns mean-revert (intraday/daily noise that never compounds) and
    understates when they trend (e.g. managed-futures sleeves). This biases the
    risk ranking and the daily-based Sharpe.
    - Add a reusable primitive **`metrics.VarianceRatio`** (Lo–MacKinlay): the
      ratio of a lower-frequency annualised variance to the daily one,
      e.g. monthly/daily. ≈1 → i.i.d.; <1 → mean reversion (daily vol
      overstates real risk); >1 → trending (it understates).
    - Surface in the comparison table: a **monthly annualised volatility**
      column **plus the variance ratio**, with an **explanatory legend/footnote**
      (what the ratio means, the small-sample caveat: weekly ~1000 pts and
      monthly ~240 are fine, annual ~20 is too noisy to show as a point
      estimate).
    - This is a recognised statistic (volatility term structure / variance
      ratio), not an ad-hoc home metric. Position it as **complementary** to the
      existing rolling-CAGR / drawdown / Ulcer / TTR metrics (which already
      capture long-horizon pain): the ratio specifically reveals the
      autocorrelation those do not show directly.
    - The same primitive would let the FIRE tool reconcile the report's daily
      vol with the annual sigma it seeds (see P2 item 9), and could feed a
      monthly-based Sharpe/Sortino variant. Note that `VarianceRatio` belongs in
      `pkg/metrics` (reusable), consumed by both the report and the FIRE seeding.

## Data history & performance (2026-07-01)

Work on extending the simulated histories back for a real 45-year FIRE backcast,
and on the currency conversion and fetch performance a EUR investor needs.

**Done:**
- **MSCI World real total return to 1969** for IWDA/URTH: Yahoo's MSCI symbols
  (`^990300-USD-STRD` etc.) return nothing to the client and MSCI's free tool
  caps at 1997, so the real monthly series (USD, 1969→, MSCI via a Curvo export)
  is embedded at `pkg/datasets/refdata/MSCIWORLD-USD.csv` (`go:embed` via
  `datasets.Refdata()`, layered into `-gen-simdata` automatically). The recipes
  use `simgen.longIndexOr` (net of TER) with the VFINX+VTMGX proxy blend as a
  fallback when the file is absent. Regenerate: `pofo -gen-simdata IE00B4L5Y983
  URTH && make`.
- **French CPI to 1955**: `^HICP-FR` is extended back with the OECD French CPI
  from FRED (`FRACPIALLMINMEI`), chained at the Eurostat overlap
  (`extendMonthlyBack`), best-effort/cached, short FRED timeout.
- **Gold real spot to 1968**: the `XAUUSD` recipe now splices the bundled
  monthly London/LBMA gold fix (`pkg/datasets/refdata/XAUUSD-LBMA.csv`, 1968→,
  from datahub `core/gold-prices`) behind the fetchable daily spot (`xauusdBuild`),
  and `longBack["GC=F"]` points at it too. Splice validated at the 2000 overlap
  (LBMA 2000-08 = $274.47 vs the daily quote $273.90). If the daily fetch fails,
  the monthly fix stands alone.
- **EUR/USD real cross to 1978**: `EURUSD=X`/`USDEUR=X` are extended back by a
  bundled monthly ECU/EUR proxy (`pkg/marketdata/data/eurusd-long.csv`: FRED
  `EXUSEC` ECU 1978-12→1998-12 chained 1:1 to `EXUSEU` euro 1999→), spliced in
  `Client.History` via `extendFXBack`. Benefits both `ConvertCurrency` (the
  convert-at-end path) and `dbmfeBuild`.
- **Perf**: the EUR/USD FX cross is fetched once per run (constant cache key,
  Yahoo). FRED was removed from the *live* FX path: it failed/stalled per USD
  asset and made runs take >1 min. FRED remains only for the (cached) French CPI;
  the euro long history is now a bundled snapshot, not a live fetch.

- **Crude to 1946 + Treasury TR to 1953** (done): `longBack["CL=F"]` → bundled
  monthly WTI spot (`WTI-USD.csv`, FRED WTISPLC). `longBack["VFITX"]`/`["VUSTX"]`
  → a constant-maturity par-bond total-return reconstruction (`simgen.TreasuryTR`,
  exact monthly repricing) bundled at `TREASURY-INT-USD.csv` (GS5, 5y) and
  `TREASURY-LONG-USD.csv` (GS20, 20y), 1953→. Stats: intermediate 5.12%/yr @
  4.3% vol, long 5.04%/yr @ 11.3% vol.
- **The real NTSG/DBMF cap was the intl-equity legs** (done). `BuildFrame` starts
  the frame at its YOUNGEST leg (`start = max` of first quotes), so extending the
  others is invisible. VTMGX (dev-ex-US) and VEIEX (EM) were capped at 1999/1994
  because their proxies were dead Yahoo MSCI symbols (`^990300-USD-STRD`,
  `^891800-USD-STRD`, which return no usable history). Fixed with bundled series:
  `DEVEXUS-USD.csv` (Ken French dev-ex-US 1990→, MSCI World before, ~1969) →
  `longBack["VTMGX"]`; `EM-USD.csv` (Ken French emerging, ~1989) →
  `longBack["VEIEX"]`. Now NTSG's start is VFINX (~1976), DBMF's is EM (~1989).
  `frame_start_test.go` reproduces the old 1999 cap and proves the fix.

- **Custom builders now extend too** (done): only `composite()`/`tsmom()` wrapped
  their fetch in `extend()`; the custom builders (`wintonBuild`, `dbmfeBuild`,
  `dpgtBuild`, `backcastBuild`) did not, so Winton stayed 2001 and a clean regen
  would have regressed DBMFE to ~2001. Every `BuildFrame` call site now uses
  `extend(f)`. Regenerate IE000O1VI174, DBMFE, GG00BQBFY362.
- **US legs extended** (done): `longBack["VFINX"]` → `SP500-USD.csv` (S&P 500 total
  return, Shiller price + reinvested dividends, ~1871 — the index VFINX tracks;
  replaced the earlier total-market proxy); `longBack["^IRX"]` → `TBILL-3M.csv`
  (FRED TB3MS, ~1934, a rate, rescaled ≈1 at the splice). NTSG's floor is now the
  dev-ex-US leg (~1969); NTSX reaches ~1953.
- **^HICP-FR long history embedded** (done): `hicp-fr.csv` now carries the OECD
  French CPI (FRED FRACPIALLMINMEI) chained before Eurostat, ~1955→, so the
  offline fallback deflates the high-inflation decades too.

- **Intl-equity proxies upgraded to true MSCI** (done): `DEVEXUS-USD.csv` is now
  MSCI World ex USA gross TR (Curvo, 1969-12→, the real ex-US universe, replacing
  the Ken-French/World approximation) and `EM-USD.csv` is MSCI Emerging Markets
  gross TR (Curvo, 1987-12→). DBMF/RSSB/VT's EM floor moves 1989→1988.

**Open:**
- **Report window**: the `-start` flag defaults to `2006-01-01`, so a plain
  `pofo` run hides all the extended history. Pass `-start 1970-01-01` (or lower
  the default / make it auto = earliest available) to see the long backcast.
- **Pre-1978 EUR/USD**: the ECU series starts 1978-12; earlier still needs a DM
  or EUA proxy. 1978 already covers a 45-year backcast, so deferred.
- **FX granularity pre-2003 is monthly** (the bundled ECU/EUR proxy). The uniform
  "convert at end in USD" stance stands; a fuller fix (per-segment currency
  conversion with a `# currency:` tag before `ExtendBack`, letting the EUR MSCI
  World Curvo export be used directly without double-counting FX) is still open
  but no longer blocking a long backcast.
- **Cache expiry**: `MaxAge` (30d) re-downloads the WHOLE historical series when
  stale, though old history never changes. Add an incremental cache (keep the
  history, fetch only the recent delta) or a long/never expiry for stable
  historical series; only recent quotes need refreshing.
- **Sandbox note**: market-data providers are unreachable from the Claude Code
  sandbox (Yahoo 429, Stooq PoW); FRED is reachable but flaky. Regeneration and
  timing must be validated on Ben's machine.

**Next-session action (on Ben's machine, needs Yahoo):** after the VFINX/^IRX +
custom-builder changes, do a FULL regen so every recipe picks them up, then
re-embed:

    pofo -gen-simdata && make

Then confirm (with e.g. `-start 1968-01-01`): NTSG (IE00077IIPQ8) reaches ~1969
(dev-ex-US leg), NTSX (IE000KF370H3) ~1953, Winton (IE000O1VI174) ~1990 (no
longer 2001), DBMF ~1989, XAUUSD ~1968, IWDA/URTH 1969. The 2nd `pofo` run
should be seconds. Bundled data regeneration recipes: FRED GS5/GS20 →
`simgen.TreasuryTR`; Ken French US/dev-ex-US/emerging → cumulate Mkt-RF+RF; FRED
WTISPLC (crude), EXUSEC+EXUSEU (EUR), TB3MS (^IRX), FRACPIALLMINMEI (HICP);
datahub gold-prices (XAUUSD-LBMA).
